<div class="description"><div style="float:left; margin:20px;">Hi and welcome to my flower shop, where we hope to make your day brighter with our flowers, this is a family business I started when I graduated from Highschool in 2005, and ever since we have been a rapidly growing business having locations worldwide and even been reviewed by many articles and shown in News as been the top-recommended store to buy a flower for loved ones for any occasion! I couldn't thank more to my family and my many employees around the world ever more, knowing that without them, this dream wouldn't be possible.</div>

<div style="margin: 20px; float: left;">Sincerely,
<div>Emily Hernandez</div></div>
